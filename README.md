Overview
This script fetches data on U.S. House of Representatives members from an API, processes the data into a structured format, and saves it to a CSV file. Luigi, a Python package for building complex pipelines, is used to manage task dependencies.

Key Functions and Classes
createHouseMembersDataFrame(src_url)

Fetches data from the specified API URL.
Parses the JSON response and extracts relevant fields for each representative.
Structures the data into a pandas DataFrame with specified columns: sortname, name, firstname, middlename, lastname, namemod, nickname, description, leadership_title, party, address, phone, and website.
Returns the DataFrame.
createDataFrameAndFile(file_name, perform_check=False)

Calls createHouseMembersDataFrame() to fetch and create the DataFrame.
Optionally checks the DataFrame structure with checkHouseMembersDataFrame() if perform_check is True.
Saves the DataFrame to a CSV file with the specified file_name.
checkHouseMembersDataFrame(df)

Validates the DataFrame by ensuring it is a pandas DataFrame and that columns match the required structure.
Ensures there are at least 431 records.
Prints a confirmation message if the DataFrame meets all requirements.
FetchDataFromOrigin (luigi.Task)

A Luigi task that creates the CSV file by calling createDataFrameAndFile().
Specifies the output path for the CSV file.
CheckResultOfFetch (luigi.Task)

A Luigi task that depends on FetchDataFromOrigin.
Reads the generated CSV file and prints the column names and row count for verification.
Marks the task as complete if successful.
Execution Flow
The script is designed to be run as a standalone Python module.
When run, it:
Checks if createHouseMembersDataFrame exists and calls createDataFrameAndFile to create the CSV file.
Initializes Luigi to manage the tasks, starting with CheckResultOfFetch, which depends on FetchDataFromOrigin.
Luigi ensures that FetchDataFromOrigin runs first to create the CSV file, then CheckResultOfFetch verifies it.
Running the Code
To execute the script:

Ensure Luigi is running (luigid in a separate terminal if using Luigi's scheduler).
Run the script directly with python script_name.py.
Dependencies
Pandas for data manipulation.
Luigi for task orchestration.
Requests for API calls.
